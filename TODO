- number list items, then jump directly upon number keypress on remote or
  keyboard

- maintain an history of windows, or at least of the most recent window; return
  to that when the next window is closed

- gimp, for example the "new image" dialog

  the problem is that the dialog is opened as a new window, but it has neither
  the override_redirect flag not the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property; when irwm
  unmaps the gimp window is unmapped to switch to the dialog, gimp unmaps the
  dialog itself

  a solution is to to never unmap (iconize) windows but just to raise the one
  to be shown; this can be done by commenting out the two XUnmapWindow in
  panelleave()

- log all properties of new windows, upon CreateNotify or MapNotify
