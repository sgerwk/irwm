- commands UPWINDOW and DOWNWINDOW to move the currently active window up or
  down in the list; currently only ENDWINDOW(e) allows moving a window; also
  STARTWINDOW could be useful

- skip windows that unmapped themselves

- switch panel on MapNotify, not on MapRequest; this requires mapping the
  window on MapRequest, but then changing activepanel only when the content is
  actually mapped

- number list items, then jump directly upon number keypress on remote or
  keyboard

- maintain an history of windows, or at least of the most recent window; return
  to that when the next window is closed

- log all properties of new windows, upon CreateNotify or MapNotify

- add an help window that explains the key to use; show it for 1-2 second upon
  startup
